# SmartChain
The SmartChain Core is the software client which allows users to read data from and interact with the Radium SmartChain.

Overview/Introduction:
The SmartChain Core is the software client which allows users to read data from and interact with the SmartChain data-layer. The software client is designed to be as user friendly as possible, and includes a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) with automated setup and sync for ease of use. SmartChain Core interacts with the SmartChain data-layer via a standard RPC connection with an existing Radium wallet. The SmartChain is easy to use, has minimal setup and no specific command line or programming skills required.

SmartChain Identities:
SmartChain Identities are created when a Radium address is paired with a username and an optional memo line. This pairing is recorded into the Radium blockchain, and can be used to record file hashes and store small amounts of text in the blockchain. The Identity's authority to perform these functions lie with the private key of the Identityâ€™s associated address.

Identity Verification:
Users can request that their Identities be verified by a third party who holds a verification key. Currently, only JJ12880 holds a verification key; however, keys will be issued to senior community members as the system expands.user account Verification is designed to provide confidence in a user's Identity and prevent username squatting. In order to become verified, a user must prove their identity through an outside medium such as Slack or Bitcointalk.

Text notes:
Users with a SmartChain Identity are able to record text notes in the blockchain to serve as a  Proof-of-Existence. All notes recorded in the blockchain can be read by anyone who wishes to do so.

File Checksum Verification:
A user can use their SmartChain Identity to record any file hash in the Radium blockchain, proving that they have access to that file at that particular time. The user can also include a title or memo, describing the file and proving the legitimacy of its contents. Once recorded, any user can check a file to see if has been recorded, and by whom.  This system allows a user to prove they are the author of a program, the existence and state of a contract, or that they had access to a particular file at a particular point in time.
